## Running `.rev` Files
To run a Reverie script file, you must replicate the following commands in your terminal.
### MacOS
```shell
source /Users/$USER/reverie.sh
reverie exec "*/yourfile.rev"
```
### Windows
```batch
reverie exec *\yourfile.bat
If your file exists, you probably should get flawless execution.
