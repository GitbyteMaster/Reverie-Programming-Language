# External Modification
All <i>external</i>, and unauthorized edits to Reverie are open for creation and distribution under specific condition. Such as the unofficial edit must vary greatly from the original scripting of Reverie, and all credit must be given to the Reverie Programming Language, and the Python Programming Language before any distribution.
