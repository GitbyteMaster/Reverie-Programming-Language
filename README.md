# What is Reverie?
Reverie is a simple object oriented programming language with the objective of mostly simplifying back-end, and if necessary, front-end development. Reverie is made with high hopes that Python (with extension) will continue to grow in numbers of software like it did before.

It is the sucessor of [PRIME Programming Language](https://github.com/GitbyteMaster/PRIME-Lang), as it is a simple, cleaner rebuild of PRIME.

Reverie gets many updates, see all of Reverie's development and what's next to come [here.](https://github.com/GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language/blob/main/TODO.md)


# Why Reverie?
The Reverie programming language comes with simplified syntax for any kind of software development. It is open source for developers to modify into a shape of their choice. It is made in Python format to work with multiple Python shells (Over version 3.8) of different devices that interpret varied syntax.

```python
put("-d", "Hello World!")
```

Type this into Command Prompt:
```batch
CURL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language/Reverie3%2B/Install.bat > C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop\Install.bat
