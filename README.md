# What is Reverie?
Reverie is a simple, mostly Python-based object oriented programming language with the objective of reutilizing the Python programming language for software developers. Reverie is made with high hopes that Python will continue to grow in numbers of software like it did before.

It is the sucessor of [PRIME Programming Language](https://github.com/GitbyteMaster/PRIME-Lang), as it is a simple, cleaner rebuild of PRIME.

Reverie gets many updates, see all of Reverie's development and what's next to come [here.](https://github.com/GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language/blob/main/TODO.md)

```python
put("-d", "Hello World!")
```

# Why Reverie?
The Reverie programming language comes with simple syntax and methods for development. It is open source for developers to modify into a shape of their choice (See [COPYRIGHT](https://github.com/GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language/blob/main/COPYRIGHT.md).) It is made in an adaptable format to work with multiple Python shells of different devices that interpret varied syntax. Overall, it is mostly a simple script interpreter.

# Contribution
Contribution is more than encouraged! As this isn't a very large project, anyone who chooses to join without any malicious intent will be informed on ways to help! ðŸ¤©
# Installation & Updating
Current Version `v0.2.2` / Version 2

Reverie is a universal Python file. To get the interpreter to work, download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
## MacOS
Once you do, type this into your command prompt once you've installed the GitHub CLI:
```shell
gh repo clone GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language
```
Or just install the essentials with `Install.sh` with this annoyingly long command:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language/Reverie3%2B/Install.sh > /Users/$USER/Desktop/Install.sh
sh /Users/$USER/Desktop/Install.sh
```
## Windows
Once you do, type this into your command prompt once you've installed the GitHub CLI:
```batch
gh repo clone GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language
```
Or just install the essentials with `Install.bat`:
```batch
CURL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language/Reverie3\%2B/Install.bat > C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop\Install.bat
CALL C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop\Install.bat
```
There! Done!
