# What is Reverie?
Reverie is an Python-based object oriented programming language with the objective of reutilizing the Python programming language for software developers. Reverie is made with high hopes that Python will continue to grow in numbers of software like it did before.

It shares the same/simliar syntax and purpose as the [PRIME Programming Language](https://github.com/GitbyteMaster/PRIME-Lang), as it is a simple, cleaner rebuild of PRIME.

Reverie gets many updates, see all of Reverie's development an what's next to come [here.](https://github.com/GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language/blob/main/TODO.md)
```
var str hw = ("Hello! would you like to see a demonstration of reverie?")
var str ans = ("no")
system.input(<hw>,<ans>)
if(<ans>=="yes"){
system.write("It can pause in seconds, like this:")
time.delay(01)
system.write("It can do math! Try it out!)
var int num1 = (00)
var int num2 = (00)
system.input("Number 1: ",<num1>)
system.input("Number 1: ",<num1>)
[<num1>+<num2>]
system.write(<*>)
}else{
system.write("Oh. Ok.")
}
```

# Why Reverie?
The Reverie programming language comes with simple syntax and methods for development. It is open source for developers to modify into a shape of their choice (See [COPYRIGHT](https://github.com/GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language/blob/main/COPYRIGHT.md).) It is made in an adaptable format to work with multiple Python shells of different devices that interpret varied syntax.
# Installation
Current Version `v0.1.3.1` / Build 13

Reverie is a universal Python file located in `Reverie-Lang.zip` file. Download Reverie [here.](https://github.com/GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language/raw/main/Reverie-Lang.zip) To get the interpreter to work, download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once finished, make sure the main `.py` file is located in this directory:
```
MAC: /Users/*/Desktop/Reverie-Lang/
WINDOWS: C://Users/*/Desktop/Reverie-Lang/
```
If you don't want to manually move the files, you can download the Reverie installer [here.](https://github.com/GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language/blob/main/ReverieSetup.py) Or you can through copying & pasting the contents into a `.py` on Mac using this command in the Mac terminal.
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitbyteMaster/Reverie-Programming-Language/main/ReverieSetup.py
```
If you are running it on the platform Darwin (Macintosh), then Reverie is already ready to use.
