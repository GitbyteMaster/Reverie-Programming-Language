# Usage
## Execution
To execute a Reverie file, Reverie must be installed, and one of the following files must exist on your device:
* `/Users/DaBros/Desktop/Reverie-Programming-Language-main/main/Assetlist/revexec.sh` [MacOS]
* `/Users/DaBros/Desktop/Reverie-Programming-Language-main/main/Assetlist/revexec.bat` [Windows]

If you don't have one of the two, installing Reverie will do the trick. After that task is completed, type one of these commands based on the device you have installed Reverie on.
> MacOS
```shell
source /Users/$USER/Desktop/Reverie-Programming-Language-main/main/Assetlist/revexec.sh
revexec ./file
```
> Windows
```batch
CALL /Users/DaBros/Desktop/Reverie-Programming-Language-main/main/Assetlist/revexec.bat ./file
```
You will receive an error if this file doesn't exist, however.
